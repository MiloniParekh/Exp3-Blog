<h2 align="center"> What Life Sounds Like</h2> 
<p>Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces &amp; pieces that combine singing&nbsp;and&nbsp;instruments.</p>

<p id="Elements of Music"> Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. Here are a few elements of music described below. </p>

<h3>Pitch and Melody</h3>
<article> Pitch is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano than to try to discern the pitch of a crash cymbal that is struck.</article>

<article> A melody (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as scales or modes. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song.</article>

<h3>Harmony and Chords</h3>
<article> Harmony refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a chord. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure.</article>

	<h3>Rhythm</h3>
	<article>Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. Meter animates time in regular pulse groupings, called measures or bars, which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as Waltz time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping.</article>a single melody (or "tune") with neither instrumental accompaniment nor a harmony part. A mother singing a lullaby to her baby would be an example.</section>

<h3>Texture</h3>
<article>Musical texture is the overall sound of a piece of music or song. The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, &amp; range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, &amp; the relationship between these voices. Texture is commonly described according to the number of &amp; relationship between parts or lines of music:
<ol>
	<li id="tex1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophony" target="_blank" title="Monophony">&lt;Monophony&gt;</a>:a single melody (or "tune") with neither instrumental accompaniment nor a harmony part. A mother singing a lullaby to her baby would be an example.</li>

	<li id="tex2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterophony" target="_blank" title="Heterophony">&lt;Heterophony&gt;</a>:two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different ornaments to the melody. </li>

	<li id="tex3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony" target="_blank" title="Polyphony">&lt;Polyphony&gt;</a>: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. Choral music written in the Renaissance music era was typically written in this style. A round, which is a song such as &quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot;, is an example of polyphony.</li>

	<li id="tex4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophony" target="_blank" title="Homophony">&lt;Homophony&gt;</a>:a clear melody supported by chordal accompaniment. Most Western popular music songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.</li>

<h3>Timbre or 'Tone Color'</h3>
<article>Timbre, sometimes called &quot;color&quot; or &quot;tone color&quot; is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440 Hz A note sounds different when it is played on oboe, piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique, different types of accessories or strings made out of different materials for string players. Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument.</article></section>

<h3>Expression</h3>
<article>Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding phrasing, by adding effects such as vibrato, dynamics &lt;the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it&gt;, tempo fluctuations, by adding pauses or fermatas on a cadence, and by changing the articulation of the notes </article>
